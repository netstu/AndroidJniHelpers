# AndroidJniHelpers
Tools for writing secure Android JNI code

The project is based upon [Spotify's JniHepers](https://github.com/the-mac/JniHelpers.git)
library. With the Android Jni Helpers library you can hide important details of your app from
basic apk decompilation, and harden your app beyond [basic code shrinking](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code.html)
from [proguard obfuscation](https://www.guardsquare.com/en/proguard). Here are some of our current features:

**Native Network Calls**
```java
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

**Native String Decoding**
```java
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

**Easy Replication of Java APIs**
```java
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

Planned Features:

**Easy Replication of Java APIs**
